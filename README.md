# Fully-commented pure CSS dropdown menus

This is a pure CSS horizontal menu with translucent vertical drop-down submenus.

The code is excessively commented to help anyone who is totally new or struggling.

The common spacing and border tweaks are fixed i.e.

- spaces that appear between `li` tags when they’re on separate lines but are styled with `display: inline-block;`
- borders you want between items but not where you *don’t* want them

This is mainly for my students, but anyone can integrate it with their existing website.
